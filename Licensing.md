# Licensing issues for Intel #

  * Need a submission that comes through the submission site.

  * Need rights to incorporate into commercial product
    * Need rights for code + patent infringement

  * Jimâ€™s understanding
    * If you own it, can give rights to others, but retain rights
    * Can license under BSD and GPL

  * Intel Patent grant into LLVM?
